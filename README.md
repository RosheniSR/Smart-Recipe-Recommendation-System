Overview of the Smart Recipe Recommendation System
The Smart Recipe Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized meal suggestions based on the ingredients users have on hand. By analyzing user input, the system recommends recipes that utilize those ingredients, helping to reduce food waste and inspire home cooking.

Workflow
User Input:

The user enters a list of ingredients they have, separated by commas.
Input Processing:

The system processes the input to normalize it (e.g., trimming whitespace and converting to lowercase).
Recipe Database:

A static list or a dynamic database of recipes is maintained, each with its associated ingredients.
Matching Logic:

The system compares the user’s input with the ingredients of each recipe in the database.
It checks for matches to identify which recipes can be made using the provided ingredients.
Recommendation Generation:

Recipes that match the user’s ingredients are collected and ranked if necessary.
Display Recommendations:

The system presents the recommended recipes to the user, including names and potentially brief descriptions.
Feedback Loop (Optional):

Users can provide feedback on the recommendations, which can be used to refine future suggestions.
Key Components
Frontend: The user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to input ingredients and view recommendations.
Backend (if applicable): A server-side component that could manage a larger database of recipes and handle more complex logic or user profiles.
Data Storage: A static or dynamic database of recipes that can be updated to include new recipes and ingredients.
